            <li>
              To confirm your booking, each person is required to pay a
              non-refundable deposit. This is a "lifetime deposit."
            </li>
            <li>All deposit funds are held in a separate bank account.</li>
            <li>
              Your deposit enables confirmation of the best rates for
              5-star accommodation and to confirm any domestic flight
              requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the event of a major global event (such as a pandemic)
              which precludes international travel, deposits will be refunded.
            </li>
            <li>If minimum tour numbers are not met, deposits will be refunded in full.</li>
            <li>
              "Lifetime Deposit" means that in the event of needing to change
              your tour choice, you may switch to a different tour no later than
              90 days before your original confirmed departure date. After that
              point, deposits cannot be switched as bookings will have been
              confirmed and paid for.
