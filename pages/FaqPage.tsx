    question: "What fitness level is required?",
    answer: "To enjoy this trip, youâ€™ll need to be able to spend time on your feet and regularly walk for 3-4 hours without assistance, including regular stints walking uphill. Daily activities might include: walking on uneven and hilly ground, getting on and off various forms of transportation, climbing stairs. You may also encounter over-the-bath showers in some of the accommodations. It will be impossible to enjoy your trip if youâ€™re not able to do a walking tour for a full afternoon and be able to keep up with the group. Unfortunately, this tour cannot accommodate people requiring a walking aid."
  },
  
  {
    question: "How many people are on the tour?",
    answer: "Our tours are intimate and personalized, with a maximum of 12 guests per group. That being said, we do require a minimum of 8 guests to run a tour. If we do not reach this minimum, you will be offered a full refund or the option to transfer to another tour."
  },
  {
    question: "What luggage can I bring?",
    answer: "1 piece (max 23kg) per person with 1 day pack. There is only so much room in the bus, so please keep your luggage to a minimum. We recommend a suitcase or duffel bag with wheels and a day pack for daily excursions."
